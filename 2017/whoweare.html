Our traditional business model is based on the accomplishment of properties in the real estate markets in America. Based on the decision of the company to diversify our properties; we have now established this corporation in Toronto. The revenues of our company are expected to be nearly US$50,000 per month depending on the variables that are factored in with investments in the real estate industry. There is a great need for certified or official bank checks in the future to deal with some real estate transactions. In addition to real estate investments, the company has invested portions of its assets in the purchase and sale of securities such as stocks and bonds as well as Forex trading on global markets.</p><p><strong>Company Strategy</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose</strong>To be a leader in the real estate industry by providing enhanced services, relationship and profitability.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong>To provide quality services that exceeds the expectations of our esteemed customers.</li><li><strong>Mission statement</strong>To build long term relationships with our customers and clients and provide exceptional customer services by pursuing business through innovation and advanced technology.</li><li><strong>Core values</strong>• We believe in treating our customers with respect and faith• We grow through creativity, invention and innovation.• We integrate honesty, integrity and business ethics into all aspects of our business functioning</li><li><strong>Goals</strong>• Regional expansion in the field of property management and develop a strong base of key customers.• Increase the assets and investments of the company to support the development of services.• To build good reputation in the field of real estate and property management and become a key player in the industry.</li></ul><p><strong>Scope of Work</strong></p><p>Johnson Corporation conducts real estate marketing as well as real estate consulting.
